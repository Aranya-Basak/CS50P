# CS50P Introduction to Python Problem solution and Final Project



This repository contains my solutions, notes, and exercises from Harvard's CS50P: *Introduction to Programming with Python*.

## 📚 Course Topics

CS50P is a beginner-friendly course focused on programming fundamentals using Python. The topics I’ve covered in this repository include:

- Functions and Variables  
- Conditionals  
- Loops  
- Exceptions  
- Libraries  
- Unit Tests  
- File I/O  
- Regular Expressions  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Final Project
